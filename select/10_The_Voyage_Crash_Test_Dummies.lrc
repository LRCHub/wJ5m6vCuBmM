[00:14.10] It may be that I'd like to
[00:20.13] But I won't fall in love with you
[00:26.66] We won't spend the rest of our lives together
[00:32.96] But anyway couldn't we go on a trip together
[00:54.96] 
[00:39.49] We could go to the British Islands
[00:45.92] And hike around the Scottish Highlands
[00:52.18] The youth hostels they have there
[00:55.48] Would be perfect for us
[00:58.86] Cause we're both youths,
[01:01.73] So they would really suit us
[01:15.73] 
[01:05.23] Well darling each morning when we woke up
[01:24.44] We'd have biscuits and tea from a tea cup
[01:31.07] People might think that we were on our honeymoon
[01:37.35] But we'd know better, even though we'd slept in the same room
[02:07.85] 
[01:43.99] We would live right out of our back packs
[01:47.38] We'd send our parents lots of trinkets and knickkacks
[01:50.23] Through the post and across the sea
[01:53.26] Back to our own country
[02:04.76] 
[02:03.40] After that we could go to Yugoslavia
[02:16.57] Oh how I'd love to travel with ya'
[02:23.18] We don't have to be wife and husband
[02:29.51] To take a trip across the ocean
