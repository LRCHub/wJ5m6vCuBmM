I am loving you more
Than I ever have before
Soon stormy clouds will pass over me
And the fear I hold in side will be no longer
Still it seems that love has taken so long
And the waiting feels like a never ending heartache

I am loving you
I am loving you more
Nights and endless days with no one

The, my spirit
If the winds of love should blow my way
Make this one feel the sun
